	Then record a new "Inventory" with negative values for the "ProductVolume"
	And record a new Inventory with positive product volume

@testcase=41356
Scenario: Update an existing Inventory with LocationType as Tanque
	And I want to adjust an 'Inventory' with "LocationType" as "Tanque"

Scenario: Update an existing Inventory and add new product
	And I want to adjust an 'Inventory' with "LocationType" as "Tanque"
	And I provide "EventType" field is equal to 'Update' and add new batch identifier

@testcase=41358 @version=2
Scenario: Verify that Inventory update should be succeeded when same batch identifier is sent to two commodities
	And I want to adjust an "Inventory" with same batch identifier
	And I provide "EventType" field is equal to "Update"
	Then record a new "Inventory" with negative values for the "ProductVolume"
	And record a new Inventory with positive product volume
	And updated should be successful for second product

@testcase=41359
Scenario: Update an existing Inventory when the Inventory Identifier does not exist
